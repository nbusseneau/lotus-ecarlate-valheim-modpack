## These restrictions lead to dynamic emergent gameplay situations.  Ex: Hauling a cart of ore and being attacked by a troll.
## If you raise this value you are nullifying the usefulness of the cart and the requirement to make paths to haul stuff. 
## This will shorten your gameplay loop and make the experience less immersive, which is not the goal of this mod.
## ZenDistributor: Unload cargo into nearby chests and adjust the cart to make the rope stronger and easier to use.
